        The implementation is responsible for validating ``params.assertion`` per RFC 7523 §3
        and the SEP-990 §5.1 processing rules, in particular:

        - require the ID-JAG's ``client_id`` claim to match the authenticated ``client`` - do
          NOT derive authorization from ``client.client_id`` alone, which for a confidential
          client is authenticated but for any client is ultimately self-asserted in the request;

          ``resource`` claim, not merely ``params.resource`` (which the client controls);
        - derive the granted scopes from the ID-JAG and policy rather than granting
          ``params.scopes`` verbatim.

        The handler guarantees ``client`` is confidential (it rejects clients without a stored
        secret before calling this hook), but the ID-JAG remains the authoritative grant.
