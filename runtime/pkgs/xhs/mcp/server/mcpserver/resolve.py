"""Resolver dependency injection for MCPServer tools.

A tool parameter annotated `Annotated[T, Resolve(fn)]` is filled by running the
resolver `fn` before the tool body, instead of from the LLM-supplied arguments.
Resolvers form a DAG: a resolver may declare its own `Resolve(...)` dependencies,
take tool arguments by name, and take the `Context`. A resolver may return a
request marker (`Elicit[T]` to ask the user, `Sample` to sample the client's
LLM, `ListRoots` to fetch its roots); the framework injects the response.

The transport follows the negotiated protocol: >= 2026-07-28 batches the requests
into an `InputRequiredResult` and resumes when the client retries with
`input_responses`/`request_state`; <= 2025-11-25 sends each standalone server-to-client
request mid-call. Only *asked* outcomes ride `request_state`, so each question is asked once. Resolver
bodies may re-run on every round; a recorded outcome is consulted only when the
body asks its question again, so a resolver's own computation always wins over
anything the client echoes back in `request_state`.

Whether the consumer receives the unwrapped model or the full
`ElicitationResult` union is decided by the consumer's annotation:

- `Annotated[T, Resolve(fn)]` -> unwrapped `T`; decline/cancel aborts the call.
- `Annotated[ElicitationResult[T], Resolve(fn)]` (or a specific member) -> the
  full outcome; the consumer branches on accept/decline/cancel.

`Sample` and `ListRoots` have no decline arm; their consumers annotate the result type directly.
