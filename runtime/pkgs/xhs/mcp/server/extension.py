"""Pluggable extension interface for MCP servers (SEP-2133).

An extension is a self-contained, opt-in bundle of MCP behaviour, identified by
a reverse-DNS string (e.g. `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`). It is passed to
`MCPServer(extensions=[...])`, and the server applies a *closed* set of
contribution kinds: tools, resources, new request methods, and one `tools/call`
interceptor. The server never hands itself to an extension; the extension
declares what it adds, and the server consumes it.

The shape follows the httpx2 `Transport`/`Auth` pattern: a narrow base class whose
methods have sensible defaults, so an extension overrides only what it needs. A
purely additive extension (Apps) overrides `tools`/`resources`; an interceptive
one overrides `methods`/`intercept_tool_call`.

This module lives at the `mcp.server` tier (not `mcp.server.mcpserver`) so the
base class itself never drags in the composition tier that consumes it;
extensions remain importable without constructing an `MCPServer`.

    when set, restricts the method to those wire versions - a request for the
    method at any other version is rejected as `METHOD_NOT_FOUND`, mirroring the
    spec's `(method, version)` boundary table. `None` (the default) admits the
    method at every version.

    Extension methods are additive: `method` must not name a spec-defined
    request method (`tools/list`, `completion/complete`, ...) — those handlers
    belong to the server, and an extension binding one would silently shadow or
    be shadowed by it. Both constraints are enforced at construction. To
    re-provide a spec method the 2026 revision removed (e.g. `logging/setLevel`
    for legacy clients), use the lowlevel `Server.add_request_handler` API
    instead — the runner's per-version surface gate would never route such a
    method to an extension handler anyway.
