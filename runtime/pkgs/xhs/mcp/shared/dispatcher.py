"""Dispatcher Protocol - the call/return boundary between transports and handlers.

A Dispatcher turns a duplex message channel into two things:

* an outbound API: `send_raw_request(method, params)` and `notify(method, params)`
* an inbound pump: `run(on_request, on_notify)` that drives the receive loop
  and invokes the supplied handlers for each incoming request/notification

It is deliberately *not* MCP-aware. Method names are strings, params and
results are `dict[str, Any]`. The MCP type layer (request/result models,
capability negotiation, `Context`) sits above this; the wire encoding
(JSON-RPC, gRPC, in-process direct calls) sits below it.

See `JSONRPCDispatcher` for the production implementation and
`DirectDispatcher` for an in-memory implementation used in tests and for
embedding a server in-process.
