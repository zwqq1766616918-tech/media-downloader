    Optimize JSON schemas in a single traversal for better performance.

    This function combines three schema cleanup operations that would normally require
    separate tree traversals:

    1. **Remove unused definitions** (prune_defs): Finds and removes `$defs` entries
       that aren't referenced anywhere in the schema, reducing schema size.

    2. **Remove titles** (prune_titles): Strips `title` fields throughout the schema
       to reduce verbosity while preserving functional information.

    3. **Remove restrictive additionalProperties** (prune_additional_properties):
       Removes `"additionalProperties": false` constraints to make schemas more flexible.

    **Performance Benefits:**
    - Single tree traversal instead of multiple passes (2-3x faster)
    - Immutable design prevents shared reference bugs
    - Early termination prevents runaway recursion on deeply nested schemas

    **Algorithm Overview:**
    1. Traverse main schema, collecting $ref references and applying cleanups

    3. Remove unused definitions based on reference analysis
