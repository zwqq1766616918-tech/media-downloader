"""An in-process, full-duplex HTTP transport for driving ASGI applications from httpx.

Ported from the MCP Python SDK's test suite (`tests/interaction/transports/_bridge.py`,
MIT licensed).

`httpx2.ASGITransport` runs the application to completion and only then hands the buffered
response to the caller, so a server that streams its response — as the streamable HTTP
transport's SSE responses do — can never converse with the client mid-request: a
server-initiated request nested inside a still-open call deadlocks.
`StreamingASGITransport` removes that limitation by running the application as a background
task and forwarding every `http.response.body` chunk to the client the moment it is sent.
Everything happens on the one event loop: no sockets, no threads, no sleeps.

The behavioural contract:

- The request body is buffered before the application is invoked (MCP requests are small
  JSON documents); the response streams chunk by chunk.
- Closing the response — or the whole client — delivers `http.disconnect` to the
  application, exactly as a real server sees when its peer goes away.
- An exception the application raises before sending `http.response.start` fails the
  originating request with that same exception. After the response has started, a failure
  is visible to the client only through the response itself (status code, truncated body) —
  the same signal a real server over a real socket would give.

The transport owns an anyio task group for the application tasks; it is opened and closed by
`httpx2.AsyncClient`'s own context manager, so the client must be used as a context manager.
Closing the transport cancels every running application task by default; set
`cancel_on_close=False` to wait for the application's own disconnect handling instead, which
is what the legacy SSE transport relies on for resource cleanup.
