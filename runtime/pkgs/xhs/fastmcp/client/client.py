- a modern protocol-version string (e.g. ``"2026-07-28"``): adopt that version directly

    MCP client that delegates connection management to a Transport instance.

    The Client class is responsible for MCP protocol logic, while the Transport
    handles connection establishment and management. Client provides methods for
    working with resources, prompts, tools and other MCP capabilities.

    This client supports reentrant context managers (multiple concurrent
    `async with client:` blocks) using reference counting and background session
    management. This allows efficient session reuse in any scenario with
    nested or concurrent client usage.

    MCP SDK 1.10 introduced automatic list_tools() calls during call_tool()
    execution. This created a race condition where events could be reset while
    other tasks were waiting on them, causing deadlocks. The issue was exposed
    in proxy scenarios but affects any reentrant usage.

    The solution uses reference counting to track active context managers,
    a background task to manage the session lifecycle, events to coordinate
    between tasks, and ensures all session state changes happen within a lock.
    Events are only created when needed, never reset outside locks.

    This design prevents race conditions where tasks wait on events that get
    replaced by other tasks, ensuring reliable coordination in concurrent scenarios.

    Args:
        transport:
            Connection source specification, which can be:

                - ClientTransport: Direct transport instance
                - FastMCP: In-process FastMCP server
                - AnyUrl or str: URL to connect to
                - Path: File path for local socket
                - MCPConfig: MCP server configuration
                - dict: Transport configuration

        roots: Optional RootsList or RootsHandler for filesystem access
        sampling_handler: Optional handler for sampling requests
        log_handler: Optional handler for log messages
        message_handler: Optional handler for protocol messages
        progress_handler: Optional handler for progress notifications
        timeout: Optional timeout for requests (seconds or timedelta)
        init_timeout: Optional timeout for initial connection (seconds or timedelta).
            Set to 0 to disable. If None, uses the value in the FastMCP global settings.
        mode: Protocol-era negotiation at connect time. `"auto"` (the default) probes
            `server/discover` and negotiates the modern era, denylist-falling-back to the
            initialize handshake for any server that is not positive evidence of a modern
            peer — safe against a mixed fleet of legacy and modern servers. `"legacy"`
            forces the initialize handshake, byte-identical to pre-v4 behavior; opt into it
            to pin the old handshake. A modern version string (e.g. `"2026-07-28"`) adopts
            that version directly without a probe.
        prior_discover: A previously obtained `DiscoverResult` to adopt when `mode` is a
            version pin, reused instead of synthesizing a minimal one. Ignored otherwise.
        input_required_max_rounds: Cap on `InputRequiredResult` (SEP-2322) retry rounds
            for `call_tool` / `get_prompt` / `read_resource` before the driver gives up.
            Only reachable on 2026-era servers that emit `InputRequiredResult`.
        cache: Client-side response caching (SEP-2549), opt-in. `None` (default) and
            `False` disable it; `True` enables the default in-memory store honoring
            server `ttlMs`/`cacheScope` hints; a `CacheConfig` customizes it. Honoring is
            modern-only, so a cache is inert on legacy connections. A custom `CacheConfig`
            store requires `target_id`, since FastMCP transports expose no server URL to
            derive a shared-store identity from.
        extensions: Opt-in client extensions (SEP-2133), a sequence of
            `mcp.client.extension.ClientExtension` instances. Each contributes its
            capability advertisement, its result claims, and its notification bindings,
            all of which are threaded into the underlying session. User-supplied
            notification bindings compose with FastMCP's internal task-status binding
            rather than replacing it. A claimed `call_tool` result is resolved
            transparently through the owning extension's resolver. For an advertise-only
            entry, use `mcp.client.advertise(identifier, settings)`.
        result_claims: Additional `ResultClaim`s (SEP-2133) keyed by the identifier of
            an extension already advertised through `extensions`, merged with that
            extension's own claims. Rarely needed directly; prefer declaring claims on
            the extension itself. Claimed shapes are modern-only and inert on a legacy
            connection.

    Examples:
        ```python
        # Connect to FastMCP server
        client = Client("http://localhost:8080")

        async with client:
            # List available resources
            resources = await client.list_resources()

            # Call a tool
            result = await client.call_tool("my_tool", {"param": "value"})
        ```
    """

    #: Whether FastMCP-internal client extensions (e.g. the tasks extension) are
    #: folded in automatically at construction. `ProxyClient` overrides this to
    #: `False`: a proxy forwards calls and must not advertise task support to its
    #: backend, since proxied tools run synchronously (forbidden mode) and the
    #: proxy has no path to drive a backend task on the front connection's behalf.
