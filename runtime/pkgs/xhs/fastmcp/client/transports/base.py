    """How one client wants its connection built.

    These belong to the client rather than to the transport, so a transport
    shared between clients doesn't leak one client's settings to another.
    Different client layers may own different fields; a layer that adds its
    settings must preserve the existing options rather than replace the bundle.

    Attributes:
        session_class: The ClientSession class to instantiate. Proxies supply a
            session that skips output-schema validation, since they relay
            results rather than consume them.
        forward_incoming_headers: Whether to forward eligible inbound HTTP
            headers upstream, including authorization. Hop-specific HTTP headers
            and MCP transport, routing, and event-stream state are excluded
            because each backend connection owns that state. Only appropriate
            for proxies; honored by the HTTP and SSE transports and ignored by
            the others.
        backend_mode: The connect `mode` to give backend clients that a wrapping
            transport builds on this client's behalf, so a chain of connections
            speaks one protocol era end to end. `None` leaves each backend
            client at its own default. Honored by `MCPConfigTransport`, whose
            multi-server form mounts a proxy per configured server and resolves
            one shared era for the aggregate; ignored by transports that connect
            to a single backend directly, since those carry the connecting
            client's own session and era.
