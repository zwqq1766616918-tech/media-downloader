"""Server-side identity assertion (ID-JAG) support for FastMCP (SEP-990).

.. warning::
    **Beta Feature**: Identity assertion support is currently in beta. The API
    may change in future releases. Please report any issues you encounter.

SEP-990 defines an enterprise "on-behalf-of" flow. A corporate identity provider
(Okta, Entra, etc.) issues an *ID-JAG* (Identity Assertion JWT Authorization
Grant) that asserts an employee's identity to a specific MCP authorization
server. The client presents that ID-JAG at the token endpoint using the RFC 7523
``urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`` grant (the RFC 8693 token-exchange
profile). This module validates the assertion and lets the authorization server
mint a short-lived access token carrying the asserted subject, with no refresh
token — the client re-exchanges a fresh ID-JAG instead, and revocation lives at
the IdP.

This module provides:

- ``IdentityAssertion``: a small pydantic config model attached to ``OAuthProxy``
  via the ``identity_assertion`` parameter.
- ``IdentityAssertionValidator``: validates an ID-JAG per RFC 7523 §3 and the
  SEP-990 processing rules, reusing FastMCP's :class:`JWTVerifier` for signature,
  issuer, audience, and expiry checks, and enforcing ``typ``, ``sub`` presence,
  and ``jti`` replay protection on top.
