"""OAuth Proxy Provider for FastMCP.

This provider acts as a transparent proxy to an upstream OAuth Authorization Server,
handling Dynamic Client Registration locally while forwarding all other OAuth flows.
This enables authentication with upstream providers that don't support DCR or have
restricted client registration policies.

Key features:
- Proxies authorization and token endpoints to upstream server
- Implements local Dynamic Client Registration with fixed upstream credentials
- Validates tokens using upstream JWKS
- Maintains minimal local state for bookkeeping
- Enhanced logging with request correlation

This implementation is based on the OAuth 2.1 specification and is designed for
production use with enterprise identity providers.

class OAuthProxy(OAuthProvider, ConsentMixin):
    """OAuth provider that presents a DCR-compliant interface while proxying to non-DCR IDPs.

    Purpose
    -------
    MCP clients expect OAuth providers to support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR),
    where clients can register themselves dynamically and receive unique credentials.
    Most enterprise IDPs (Google, GitHub, Azure AD, etc.) don't support DCR and require
    pre-registered OAuth applications with fixed credentials.

    This proxy bridges that gap by:
    - Presenting a full DCR-compliant OAuth interface to MCP clients
    - Translating DCR registration requests to use pre-configured upstream credentials
    - Proxying all OAuth flows to the upstream IDP with appropriate translations
    - Managing the state and security requirements of both protocols

    Architecture Overview
    --------------------
    The proxy maintains a single OAuth app registration with the upstream provider
    while allowing unlimited MCP clients to register and authenticate dynamically.
    It implements the complete OAuth 2.1 + DCR specification for clients while
    translating to whatever OAuth variant the upstream provider requires.

    Key Translation Challenges Solved
    ---------------------------------
    1. Dynamic Client Registration:
       - MCP clients expect to register dynamically and get unique credentials
       - Upstream IDPs require pre-registered apps with fixed credentials
       - Solution: Accept DCR requests, return shared upstream credentials

    2. Dynamic Redirect URIs:
       - MCP clients use random localhost ports that change between sessions
       - Upstream IDPs require fixed, pre-registered redirect URIs
       - Solution: Use proxy's fixed callback URL with upstream, forward to client's dynamic URI

    3. Authorization Code Mapping:
       - Upstream returns codes for the proxy's redirect URI
       - Clients expect codes for their own redirect URIs
       - Solution: Exchange upstream code server-side, issue new code to client

    4. State Parameter Collision:
       - Both client and proxy need to maintain state through the flow
       - Only one state parameter available in OAuth
       - Solution: Use transaction ID as state with upstream, preserve client's state

    5. Token Management:
       - Clients may expect different token formats/claims than upstream provides
       - Need to track tokens for revocation and refresh
       - Solution: Store token relationships, forward upstream tokens transparently

    OAuth Flow Implementation
    ------------------------
    1. Client Registration (DCR):
       - Accept any client registration request
       - Store ProxyDCRClient that accepts dynamic redirect URIs

    2. Authorization:
       - Store transaction mapping client details to proxy flow
       - Redirect to upstream with proxy's fixed redirect URI
       - Use transaction ID as state parameter with upstream

    3. Upstream Callback:
       - Exchange upstream authorization code for tokens (server-side)
       - Generate new authorization code bound to client's PKCE challenge
       - Redirect to client's original dynamic redirect URI

    4. Token Exchange:
       - Validate client's code and PKCE verifier
       - Return previously obtained upstream tokens
       - Clean up one-time use authorization code

    5. Token Refresh:
       - Forward refresh requests to upstream
       - Handle token rotation if upstream issues new refresh token
       - Update local token mappings

    State Management
    ---------------
    The proxy maintains minimal but crucial state via pluggable storage (client_storage):
    - _oauth_transactions: Active authorization flows with client context
    - _client_codes: Authorization codes with PKCE challenges and upstream tokens
    - _jti_mapping_store: Maps FastMCP token JTIs to upstream token IDs
    - _refresh_token_store: Refresh token metadata (keyed by token hash)

    All state is stored in the configured client_storage backend (Redis, disk, etc.)
    enabling horizontal scaling across multiple instances.

    Security Considerations
    ----------------------
    - Refresh tokens stored by hash only (defense in depth if storage compromised)
    - PKCE enforced end-to-end (client to proxy, proxy to upstream)
    - Authorization codes are single-use with short expiry
    - Transaction IDs are cryptographically random
    - All state is cleaned up after use to prevent replay
    - Token validation delegates to upstream provider

    Provider Compatibility
    ---------------------
    Works with any OAuth 2.0 provider that supports:
    - Authorization code flow
    - Fixed redirect URI (configured in provider's app settings)
    - Standard token endpoint

    Handles provider-specific requirements:
    - Google: Ensures minimum scope requirements
    - GitHub: Compatible with OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps
    - Azure AD: Handles tenant-specific endpoints
    - Generic: Works with any spec-compliant provider

            token_verifier: Token verifier for validating access tokens
            base_url: Public URL of the server that exposes this FastMCP server; redirect path is
                relative to this URL
            resource_base_url: Optional public base URL for the protected resource metadata
                and token audience. Defaults to ``base_url``.
            redirect_path: Redirect path configured in upstream OAuth app (defaults to "/auth/callback")
            issuer_url: Issuer URL for OAuth metadata (defaults to base_url)
            service_documentation_url: Optional service documentation URL
            allowed_client_redirect_uris: List of allowed redirect URI patterns for MCP clients.
                Patterns support wildcards (e.g., "http://localhost:*", "https://*.example.com/*").
                If None (default), DCR clients use registered redirect URIs, with loopback
                ports allowed to vary for MCP compatibility. Unsafe browser schemes are rejected.
                If empty list, no redirect URIs are allowed.
                These are for MCP clients performing loopback redirects, NOT for the upstream OAuth app.
            valid_scopes: List of all the possible valid scopes for a client.
                These are advertised to clients through the `/.well-known` endpoints. Defaults to `required_scopes` if not provided.
            forward_pkce: Whether to forward PKCE to upstream server (default True).
                Enable for providers that support/require PKCE (Google, Azure, AWS, etc.).
                Disable only if upstream provider doesn't support PKCE.
            token_endpoint_auth_method: Token endpoint authentication method for upstream server.
                Common values: "client_secret_basic", "client_secret_post", "none".
                Defaults to "client_secret_basic".
            extra_authorize_params: Additional parameters to forward to the upstream authorization endpoint.
                Useful for provider-specific parameters like Auth0's "audience".
                Example: {"audience": "https://api.example.com"}
            extra_token_params: Additional parameters to forward to the upstream token endpoint.
                Useful for provider-specific parameters during token exchange.
            client_storage: Storage backend for OAuth state (client registrations, tokens).
                If None, an encrypted file store will be created in the data directory.
            jwt_signing_key: Secret for signing FastMCP JWT tokens (any string or bytes).
                If bytes are provided, they will be used as-is.
                If a string is provided, it will be derived into a 32-byte key using PBKDF2 (1,000,000 iterations).
                If not provided, it will be derived from the upstream client secret using HKDF.
            require_authorization_consent: Consent screen behavior (default True).
                - True: always show the consent screen before redirecting to the
                  upstream IdP. Strongest protection against AS-in-the-middle
                  attacks.
                - "remember": show the consent screen the first time, then silently
                  approve subsequent authorizations for the same (client_id,
                  redirect_uri) in the same browser. Cross-site navigations are
                  still prompted to block AS-in-the-middle attacks. Lower UX
                  friction, but weaker protection than True.
                - "external": follow the same authorization path as False, but
                  suppress the warning as an operator acknowledgment that equivalent
                  consent and transaction-binding protections are enforced externally.
                  FastMCP does not provide or verify those external protections.
                - False: skip consent entirely. SECURITY WARNING: only set to
                  False for local development or testing environments.
            consent_csp_policy: Content Security Policy for the consent page.
                If None (default), uses the built-in CSP policy with appropriate directives.
                If empty string "", disables CSP entirely (no meta tag is rendered).
                If a non-empty string, uses that as the CSP policy value.
                This allows organizations with their own CSP policies to override or disable
                the built-in CSP directives.
            fallback_access_token_expiry_seconds: Expiry time to use when upstream provider
                doesn't return `expires_in` in the token response. If not set, uses smart
                defaults: 1 hour if a refresh token is available (since we can refresh),
                or 1 year if no refresh token (for API-key-style tokens like GitHub OAuth Apps).
                Set explicitly to override these defaults.
            fallback_refresh_token_expiry_seconds: Expiry time to use when upstream provider
                doesn't return `refresh_expires_in` (e.g. Cognito, GitHub, many OIDC IdPs).
                Defaults to 1 year. Note: this only controls the FastMCP-issued refresh token
                lifetime — the actual upstream refresh remains the source of truth. If the
                upstream rejects the refresh, the client gets `invalid_grant` and re-auths,
                regardless of how much life is left on the FastMCP refresh token.
            fastmcp_access_token_expiry_seconds: Lifetime for the FastMCP-issued access
                token (JWT), decoupling it from the upstream provider's `expires_in`. By
                default (None) the FastMCP access token mirrors the upstream access token
                lifetime. The FastMCP JWT is a reference token — `load_access_token`
                re-validates the upstream token on every request and transparently refreshes
                it when expired — so issuing a longer-lived FastMCP token does not extend
                upstream access: a revoked or expired upstream session still fails validation
                and forces re-auth. Set this for bridges whose upstream issues short-lived
                access tokens (5-60 min) that some MCP clients can't refresh gracefully
                (e.g. `mcp-remote`), where the short client-facing TTL forces a full re-auth
                on every idle period. Only affects the FastMCP-issued token; the upstream
                token's real expiry is preserved internally to drive transparent refresh.
                When the upstream provider issues no refresh token there is no way to renew
                the access token, so the lifetime is capped at the upstream `expires_in`
                regardless of this value (it can still be used to shorten it).
            token_expiry_threshold_seconds: Number of seconds before actual expiry to consider
                a token as expired (default 0). This prevents race conditions where a token
                passes the expiry check but expires before the next operation completes.
                For example, set to 30 to refresh tokens that will expire within 30 seconds.
            enable_cimd: Enable CIMD (Client ID Metadata Document) support for URL-based
                client IDs. When True, clients can authenticate using HTTPS URLs as client
                IDs, with metadata fetched from the URL. Supports private_key_jwt auth.
            identity_assertion: Optional SEP-990 identity assertion (ID-JAG) configuration.
                When provided, the token endpoint accepts the RFC 7523 jwt-bearer grant
                carrying an ID-JAG issued by one of the configured trusted issuers, and
                mints a short-lived access token (no refresh token) for the asserted
                subject. When omitted, the grant is rejected as unsupported.
