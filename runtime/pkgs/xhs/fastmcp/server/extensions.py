"""FastMCP-native server extension API (SEP-2133).

An MCP extension is an opt-in, capability-negotiated bundle of protocol
behaviour identified by a reverse-DNS string (e.g. `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks`).
Unlike the SDK's `mcp.server.extension.Extension`, a FastMCP `ServerExtension`
is bound to its `FastMCP` instance at registration, so its request handlers and
its `tools/call` interceptor can reach the component registry, `Context`, and
auth scope that the SDK's model withholds.

An extension contributes any subset of four things:

- **A negotiated capability.** `settings()` is spliced into
  `ServerCapabilities.extensions[identifier]` (see `LowLevelServer.get_capabilities`).
- **New request methods.** `methods()` returns `MethodBinding`s, each wired onto
  the low-level server via `add_request_handler` when the extension is registered.
- **A `tools/call` interceptor.** `intercept_tool_call()` is the last gate before
  a tool body runs — it composes *after* the FastMCP middleware chain and *before*
  component execution, so it can observe, short-circuit, or pass a call through.
- **A lifespan.** `lifespan()` is entered with the server's lifespan and exited on
  shutdown — the hook the SDK's `Extension` lacks, needed to start backends/workers.

The base class follows the SDK's httpx-style shape: every contribution method has
a default, so a subclass overrides only what it needs.
