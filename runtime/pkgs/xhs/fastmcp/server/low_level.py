    v2 no longer lets FastMCP subclass ``ServerSession`` (the runner constructs
    it per request), so the old ``MiddlewareServerSession._received_request``
    override is replaced by a ``ServerMiddleware`` — an ordinary entry in the
    SDK's own middleware list. Sitting at the root of dispatch, this
    is the single entry point through which *every* inbound message flows —
    requests, notifications, cancellations, ``initialize``, and even malformed or
    unroutable messages the SDK can still hand us. It binds the FastMCP
    request-context ContextVar and re-applies the app-scoped ``SharedContext`` for
    the whole chain, then runs the FastMCP ``Middleware`` chain so
    ``on_message`` / ``on_request`` / ``on_notification`` observe the message.

    Dispatch shapes:

    - Negotiation runs the *whole* FastMCP chain here: ``initialize`` dispatches
      through ``on_initialize`` and ``server/discover`` through ``on_discover``.
      Neither has an interior FastMCP handler adapter, and the SDK serializes both
      results before returning through its middleware seam, so this root adapter
      restores core results to typed models before FastMCP middleware observes them.
    - The component methods (``tools/call``, ``tools/list``, ``resources/read``,
      ...) still run their FastMCP chain *interior*, in the handler adapter, where
      ``on_call_tool`` receives the typed component result and a tool exception
      propagates through ``on_message``/``on_request`` exactly where the built-in
      error/logging/timing middleware expect it. The root dispatch does not re-run the
      chain for these — it only steps in when such a request fails *before* the
      interior runs (malformed params, routing), so ``on_message`` still observes
      the failure.
    - Every other message — all notifications (including ``notifications/cancelled``
      and ``notifications/initialized``), ``ping``, ``logging/setLevel``, and any
      unroutable/non-component request — has no interior FastMCP dispatch, so the
      root dispatch runs the ``"outer"`` pass (``on_message`` plus
      ``on_request``/``on_notification``) here, wrapping the real SDK dispatch.
      This closes the long-standing gap where these messages were invisible to
      FastMCP middleware.
